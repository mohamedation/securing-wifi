      <p>
        This guide is intended for the average home user. It uses simple
        language and summarizes steps, actions, and risks. It is for educational
        purposes only. Please do not use it to break the law. It may contain
        some technical errors or linguistic mistakes. Please report them to me
        so that I can improve the guide. This guide explains the importance of
        securing your wireless network and the risks of leaving it vulnerable.
        It is not about how to secure the devices connected to your network.
        Instead, it focuses on how to secure the network itself, such as by
        changing the default password, enabling encryption, and creating a guest
        network. I hope this guide helps you keep your home network safe.
      </p>

      <h1 id="intro" class="h-style">Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        The increasing popularity of smart home devices has led to a growing
        number of wireless networks in our homes. While this convenience comes
        at a price, as wireless networks are more vulnerable to attack than
        wired networks. This guide aims to provide a simple and
        easy-to-understand guide for the average home user to add more layers of
        security to their wireless network and improve their privacy. The first
        version of this guide was in PDF format and Arabic, but I thought that
        making it in the form of a one-page website accessible from any device
        without downloading anything would be more appealing and easier to use.
        This would also make it easier to translate the guide into more
        languages to help more people secure their networks and privacy. It is
        important to note that no network is 100% secure, but by following the
        tips in this guide, you can make it more difficult for hackers to access
        your network and your data.

      <h1 id="router" class="h-style">Router</h1>
      <p>
        The starting point for securing your home WiFi network is the router.
        Most modern home routers are actually three devices in one: a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem" target="_blank">Modem</a>,
        a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)"
          target="_blank"
          >Router</a
        >, and a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point"
          target="_blank"
          >Wireless Access Point</a
        >. For simplicity, I will call it a router throughout this guide. A
        router is the gateway between your local network and the internet. It is
        responsible for routing traffic between your devices and the internet.
        Most routers come with preconfigured firewall settings to block
        malicious attacks and unauthorized connections from the internet.
        However, there are other settings that you can configure to further
        secure your network. If you are in the market for a new router, I
        recommend doing some research to read reviews and learn about any known
        issues or vulnerabilities. You can use a search phrase like TD-W8970
        Vulnerability to find information about specific routers. If you already
        have a router, it is also important to check for any known issues or
        vulnerabilities and to update the firmware if there are any updates
        available.<br />
        There are two main ways to connect to your router's settings:
      </p>
      <div class="col-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Using a web browser</h2>
          <p>
            Most routers have a web-based interface that you can use to
            configure the settings. To do this, you will need to know the
            router's IP address. This address is usually printed on the back of
            the router.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Using a mobile app</h2>
          <p>
            Many routers also have mobile apps that you can use to configure the
            settings. This is a convenient option if you do not have a computer
            or if you prefer to use a mobile device.

      </div>
      <img class="info-img" src="/images/content/local-router-access.webp" />
      <br />
      <p>This can be done through 2 ways:</p>
      <div class="col-2">
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Local Access</h2>
          <p>
            Local Access means connecting to your router from your local
            network. In other words, from any of the devices that are connected
            to your WiFi network or from any device connected to your router via
            a LAN cable. This is the default way you should use and the more
            secured than Remote Access method. There are sub methods under Local
            Access to connect to the router, but the best and simple way for a
            home user is to connect to the router via the web interface meaning
            you connect to the router using your internet browser (such as
            Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and..ehm..Internet explorer or Microsoft
            Edge) and you do so by typing the Local Internet Protocol Address
            (Local IP for short) in the address bar of the browser and most
            routers use the IP "192.168.1.1" or "192.168.1.254" out of the box,
            but if you don't get to a page using those 2 addresses, then review
            your router's manual. Some devices will have the option to only
            allow devices connected to the router via the LAN cable to get to
            the router settings and most routers will come with a short cable
            that you can use for this purpose. You should enable this option if
            it exists to limit the access to the router's settings page and use
            the cable whenever you need to access it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Remote Access</h2>
          <p>
            If the router is a gateway, then as you can reach it from the local
            network, you can reach it from the other side. why? maybe you are
            traveling or away from home, but need to modify the settings or
            simply you are facing some issues and your ISP (Internet Service
            Provider) needs to access the router to see whats the problem while
            your on the phone with them rather than wait for a home visit. No
            matter what the reason, the option is there and you need to disable
            it whenever you don't specifically need it. When you want to use
            this method to access your router from outside your local network,
            You would use the router's "<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address"
              target="_blank"
              >Public IP Address</a
            >" rather than the local address (such as 192.168.1.1) and you can
            search google for "<a
              href="https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+my+IP+address"
              target="_blank"
              >What is my IP address</a
            >" to find out your public IP address. Keep in mind that some ISP
            will change your public IP address from time to time if they don't
            provide you with a static IP address. All of these options will be
            under a section called "Access Control" in the router's web
            interface page.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h1 id="access control" class="h-style">Access Control</h1>
      <p>
        After connecting to the router's settings page, You will be asked for a
        username and a password.The default username and password are usually
        "admin" for both. You can find the default password in your router's
        manual or by searching the internet for your router's model and "default
        password". The first thing you should do after logging in, is change the
        default username and password to something else, because as you guessed,
        everyone would know and try them if they could reach the router's page.
        You would be amazed by how many routers are still using the default
        credentials and accessible from the internet through the remote access
        option which are even periodically cataloged by search engines such as
        <a href="https://www.shodan.io/search?query=router" target="_blank"
          >Shodan</a
        >. You should use a strong, unique password that have no meaning to you
        or in the language such as "bwpFW93F#fm20BN" or "HeLuWK2038Be30" and if
        Your router allows You to change the username, You should change it from
        "admin" to anything else and preferably not your name or a name that has
        any connection with you, if possible. You should also make sure that if
        Your router comes with hard-coded users such as "user" and "support",
        that You change the password for those as well.

        />
        The layout and the naming of sections could vary from router to router,
        but you should be able to figure out what you are looking for in a
        little time with the help of this guide and your router's manual or of
        course, the internet. Under this section (Access Control) You will also
        find the remote access option and should disable it if you don't need
        it. All the sub option under remote access should be disabled and
        enabled only when needed for a short amount of time.
        <img
          class="info-img"
          src="/images/content/management-remote-access.webp"
        />
      </p>

      <h1 id="network name" class="h-style">Network Name</h1>
      <p>
        Naming Your WiFi with a name that can lead back to You is not really
        safe because it provides an easy way for a potential attacker who might
        be looking for You specifically especially if You live in an urban area.
        Or could simply provide someone who is looking to gain access to the
        network with easy information that could be leveraged to give him
        access, for example a neighbor who might know your kids name and finds
        your WiFi network name could try Your kids names for the password..or
        your phone number, pet's name..etc.
        <img class="info-img" src="/images/content/wireless-name.webp" /> You
        could also choose to "Hide SSID Broadcast" (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)"
          target="_blank"
          >SSID simply means the WiFi network name</a
        >) so that when someone is looking for available WiFi networks will not
        see that Your WiFi exists and Your devices who already connected to the
        network before would connect normally as usually and new devices can
        easily connect by choosing "Other Networks" or "Connect to a hidden
        Network" when trying to connect. This option adds a good layer of
        security especially to deter amateurs or just those are looking for a
        free internet access, but a more professional attacker will be still
        able to see Your network. As a good measure, You shouldn't leave the
        WiFi name (SSID) with the default value because it would give easy info
        to amateurs trying to get access to your network by figuring the
        device's default passwords or services and even vulnerabilities if they
        exist. Some ISP that provide the router for You can sometimes
        preconfigure it to broadcast their name which is an easy way to gather
        info about You or the network. However, every router has a unique ID
        that is called "MAC Address" and that's short for "<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address"
          target="_blank"
          >Media Access Control Address</a
        >" which will allow a more advanced attacker to know the device's
        manufacture at least. Your router could have an option called "Clients
        Isolation" or something similar which will prevent the devices connected
        to the router or on the network from communicating with each other and
        this is a good measure in case someone did breach your network, but this
        means you won't be able to connect to your chromecast for example or
        your WiFi enabled coffee maker.
      </p>

      <h1 id="encryption" class="h-style">Authinication Encryption</h1>
      <p>
        Still to this day, this is one of the biggest problems and security
        issue when it comes to WiFi. Some home users would simply ignore this
        security measure for some reason or another. According to "<a
          href="https://wigle.net/stats"
          target="_blank"
          >Wigle</a
        >" which is a database for WiFi networks gathered through "<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving"
          target="_blank"
          >Wardriving</a
        >", there are 19,716,016 WiFi network out of 290,179,693 widely open for
        anyone to access. Those include public hotspots and free WiFi, but also
        home networks that their owners don't care, or don't know better. Its
        Authentication Encryption so its not network encryption. It simply means
        that the method the password to the WiFi network is encrypted with
        before a device asking to join the network provide this password to the
        router to prove that the device is allowed on the network. If you use a
        weak encryption, then someone monitoring this operation could easily
        capture and decrypt the password. In general there are 4 settings:
        <img
          class="info-img"
          src="/images/content/wireless-encryption-type2.webp"
        />
      </p>
      <ul class="enc-typ">
        <li><img src="/images/icons/wifi-open.svg" width="64" />Open</li>
        <li><img src="/images/icons/wifi-web.svg" width="64" />WEP</li>
        <li><img src="/images/icons/wifi-wpa.svg" width="64" />WPA</li>
        <li><img src="/images/icons/wifi-wpa2.svg" width="64" />WPA2</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="open">Open</h2>
      <p>
        Do not leave your WiFi network open. This is a security risk, as anyone
        could connect to your network and access your devices and data. If you
        want to share your network with others, it is better to use strong
        encryption and a password that is difficult to guess. You can also
        enable the "Guest Network" option on your router, which will create a
        separate WiFi network for guests that is isolated from your main
        network.
      </p>

      <h2 id="wep">Wired Equivalent Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Or WEP for short, has a misleading name. Basically, it's as good as
        leaving the WiFi network Open. WEP is a security protocol for wireless
        networks that was developed in the late 1990s. It is the oldest and
        weakest Wi-Fi security protocol. WEP uses a 64-bit or 128-bit key to
        encrypt data, but this key can be easily cracked by attackers using
        tools like
        <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/" target="_blank">Aircrack-Ng</a>.
        In fact, WEP passwords can be cracked in as little as two minutes. Some
        old routers use this setting by default.
        <img class="info-img" src="/images/content/WEP.webp" />
      </p>

      <h2 id="wpa">WPA and WPA2 Protocols</h2>
      <p>
        After it was discovered how vulnerable WEP was, the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance" target="_blank"
          >WiFi Alliance</a
        >
        quickly moved in the direction of implementing a more secure way for
        authentication and introduced WPA in 2003 as a quick fix for WEP and to
        pave the way for the more secure and complex protocol; WPA2 that became
        available in 2004. So the only way to have a good and powerful
        authentication encryption is to use WPA2 with a good password and
        without enabling <a href="#WPS">WPS</a>. As always, WEP and WPA are kept
        as options to provide backward compatibility. WPA and WPA2 can still be
        broken if You use a week and/or common passwords and in case of targeted
        attack, a password that is personal like Birth-dates, anniversaries,
        names ..etc. so using WPA2 and using a password like "apple" or
        "123456789" is simply idiotic. The best practice is to use WPA2-personal
        (or WPA2 with AES, CCMP, AES-CCMP) which differs from router to router,
        but means the same thing. AES or (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"
          target="_blank"
          >the Advanced Encryption Standard</a
        >) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data. You can
        read more about how encryption work and such, but to make things simple,
        let's say that AES for example uses an algorithm that calculate or
        cipher the password into a hash or ciphered string and that ciphered
        string can't be recalculated back to the original word so encrypting the
        word "apple" with AES gives us "2fsGsNtyFu8Y16fWGLMxMA==" (<a

          target="_blank"
          >read more about Cryptographic hash function</a
        >) so if an attacker got hold of the hashed string, he/she can't turn it
        back to "apple", but the attacker could use the same encryption method
        to encrypt random words or passwords and then compare the strings
        generated to the encrypted password he/she got. Attackers will use
        AirCrack-ng to capture the handshake between the router and the devices
        connecting to it and can use 2 attacks methods to "crack" the WPA2
        password. Those 2 methods are

        and they both combined, target weak, common, meaningful, and short

        when it comes to choosing your WiFi password (and any password for that

        Simply, it is a serial number that belongs to the wireless chip in Your
        devices being a laptop, tablet, or mobile phone and as the title
        implies, MAC filtering is an option to create a list of MAC addresses to
        either be allowed or denied from the network and the best practice is to
        create a list with all the devices that will connect to the WiFi network
        and only allow those devices using the MAC filtering option. Keep in
        mind that MAC addresses could be

        You might think that's alright if someone have access to your WiFi
        network and You are all about sharing that internet with others, helping
        them connect, but the risks are far more dangerous than you might think.
        a Person could just mess with Your network settings for fun or as a
        prank. another could use Your network to access the internet to
        download/upload illegal materials implicating You. an online drug dealer
        could be connecting to the TOR network through Your WiFi. All of this
        isn't so dangerous after all. a more malicious person could do a lot
        more targeting You, Your Privacy, Data, Photos, and more.

        is psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or
        divulging confidential information. It is a type of art and highly
        depends on the attacker's personality and ability, but also on the
        background information he/she can use to convince manipulate You and an
        attacker can figure out a wealth of information just by being connected
        to your WiFi. It's easy to figure out the type of devices You have in
        Your home and the names of people using them and can leverage all this
        information to even get more through social media and the internet using
        simple tools and techniques.
        <img class="info-img" src="/images/content/se.webp" />
        Sometimes, Your router settings might contain some personal information
        such as your ISP user-name and password and such. Some ISP even let
        anyone browsing their portal through the network, to access the
        subscription settings without authentication, but that is rare nowadays.
        <img class="info-img" src="/images/content/ppp-username.webp" />
        You could be even using the same WiFi password for Your online accounts
        (shame on YOU) which once cracked, the attacker might use to gain access
        to Your accounts or could use a tool like

        devices and the internet and possibly even altering them, serving You
        with spoofed sites to gather your passwords, banking information and
        even trick You to install malware that could help him/her take full
        control of Your device (Flash needs to be updated? sure install
        updates). The attacker can also "sniff" or eavesdropping on Your

      <h2 id="exploite">Exploiting</h2>
      <p>
        Exploiting could sound more difficult than it really is. Most likely, an
        attacker can connect to different devices on the network using default
        user-names and passwords or even without needing them, because home
        users don't know any better. You have this monitoring camera that could
        only be accessed from the local network, so who needs a user-name and a
        password, right? WRONG! You should really make sure that every device
        and service on the network requires authentication and that the default
        credentials are changed to something more secured and that they don't
        face the outside network (the internet) if you don't really need to
        access them from outside Your home network, same as the router or they
        can be used in botnets to launch attacks such as DDOS attack (like the
        <a

        <a href="https://www.shodan.io/" target="_blank">Shodan</a> would yield
        a lot of webcams, security cams, storage devices, and more "smart"
        devices connected to the internet and available to everyone without any
        security measures or with the default credentials that can even allow an
        attacker to gain access to your WiFi network without targeting Your
        router or AP. Exploiting is even more dangerous than that, because a lot
        of devices and services might contain vulnerabilities that allows the
        attacker to gain access. These vulnerabilities could be known to the
        public and might already have updates or patches to fix them, but the
        home user didn't update the devices, or they could be unknown yet to the
        public and only the attacker (or a few people) knows about them and
        those are called

        >
        and there are no updates or patches available yet to fix them. That's
        why you should periodically update Your OS (Operating systems),
        applications, and the devices firmwares such as routers, security cams,
        and Your smart fridge.

      <h1 id="conclusion" class="h-style">Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        By following the tips in this guide, you can improve the security of
        your home WiFi network and make it more difficult for hackers to access
        your devices and data.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose a strong password for your WiFi network. The password should be
          at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and
          lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use WPA2 encryption. This is the most secure encryption protocol
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hide your WiFi network's SSID. This will make it more difficult for
          hackers to find your network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only allow trusted devices to connect to your network. You can do this
          by using MAC filtering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your router's firmware up to date. Router manufacturers often
          release security updates to fix vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be careful what you connect to your network. Only connect devices that
          you trust.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor your network for suspicious activity. There are a number of
          ways to do this, such as using a security app or service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some additional tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Don't use your WiFi network name to reveal any personal information
          about yourself, such as your name, address, or phone number.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't leave your WiFi network open to the public, even if you only
          intend to share it with a few people.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the default password for your router. The default password is
          usually easy to guess.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disable remote administration for your router. This will prevent
          unauthorized people from accessing your router from the internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your router in a secure location. Don't place it in an area where
          it is easily accessible to unauthorized people.
        </li>
      </ul>
